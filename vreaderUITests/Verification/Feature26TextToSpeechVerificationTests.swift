// Purpose: CU-free Gate-5 verification suite for Feature #26 —
// "Text-to-Speech read aloud".
//
// Feature #26 ships TTS read-aloud: the user starts narration from the
// reader's More (⋯) popover "Read aloud" row, a `TTSControlBar` mounts
// at the bottom of the reader with play/pause + stop controls, and the
// `TTSService` state machine drives `.idle → .speaking → .paused →
// .speaking → .idle`.
//
// Why this suite exists — the pause/resume reachability gap:
//   The prior Gate-5 rounds (`feature-26-20260507/09/13-round3.md`,
//   round-4, round-5) verified TTS start + the genuine-speech signal
//   (monotonic `ttsOffsetUTF16`) + stop teardown across TXT / EPUB / MD,
//   but the `TTSControlBar` *pause/resume* button itself was never
//   exercised by automation: round-4/round-5 ran CU-free via the
//   `vreader-debug://tts` DebugBridge command, which only exposes
//   start / stop — there is no `tts?action=pause` URL, so the
//   pause/resume control was physically unreachable. An XCUITest suite
//   drives the app through the accessibility API and CAN synthesize a
//   tap on that button, closing the gap.
//
// What this suite verifies (feature #26 acceptance criteria):
//   - C1 (start): open a seeded book, open the reader More popover, tap
//     the "Read aloud" row → the `TTSControlBar` mounts (its play/pause
//     + Stop controls appear) and the play/pause control is in its
//     "Pause" affordance — i.e. `TTSService` is in `.speaking`.
//   - C2 (pause): tap the control bar's play/pause button while
//     speaking → the button's accessibility label flips from "Pause" to
//     "Resume" (the `TTSService.State`-driven label on `TTSControlBar`'s
//     play/pause `Button`), proving the `.speaking → .paused` transition.
//   - C3 (resume): tap the play/pause button again while paused → the
//     label flips back to "Pause" — the full `.speaking → .paused →
//     .speaking` cycle.
//   - C4 (stop teardown): tap the "Stop reading" button → the whole
//     `TTSControlBar` is removed (play/pause + Stop both gone), proving
//     the `.idle` transition tears the control bar down.
//
// Design / pattern notes:
//   - Launches with `--tts-test-mode` (feature #45 WI-4e): `TTSService`
//     is constructed with `XCUITestMockSpeechSynthesizer` instead of the
//     real `AVSpeechSynthesizer`, because the real synth's audio session
//     does not activate under XCUITest headless mode on the iPhone 17
//     Pro Simulator — the F40/F41 verification suites established this.
//     The mock fires synthetic `didStart` / `willSpeakRange` / `didFinish`
//     delegate callbacks on a self-rescheduling tick that genuinely
//     SUSPENDS while `pauseSpeaking()` holds it, so the paused state is
//     stable for the test's full assertion window rather than racing to
//     `didFinish`.
//   - **Pure XCUITest — no DebugBridge snapshot.** Unlike the F40/F41
//     suites, this suite does NOT read the `vreader-debug://snapshot`
//     `ttsState` JSON. The `TTSService.State` is fully observable from
//     the XCUITest accessibility tree itself: `TTSControlBar`'s
//     play/pause `Button` carries `.accessibilityLabel("Pause")` while
//     `.speaking` and `.accessibilityLabel("Resume")` while `.paused`,
//     and the whole bar unmounts on `.idle`. The button label IS the
//     state machine — observing it needs no out-of-process `simctl`
//     round-trip (which is unreliable from the sandboxed XCUITest
//     runner). Every assertion here is an element query against the
//     live app.
//   - Drives the app entirely through the XCUITest accessibility API
//     (element queries + synthesized taps) — no computer-use. The
//     book-open uses the library card tap, NOT the DebugBridge `open`
//     URL (which cannot reliably commit a NavigationStack push in a
//     headless `simctl openurl` session — see the feature-#54 pilot,
//     `Feature54ReadingModeRemovalVerificationTests`).
//   - **Query by accessibility LABEL, not by per-element identifier.**
//     The feature-#54 / #63 pilots drew this lesson from Bug #214 /
//     #223: a SwiftUI container's `.accessibilityIdentifier` propagates
//     onto — and clobbers — its leaf elements' own identifiers. Both
//     the More popover (`ReaderMorePopover`'s root carries
//     `accessibilityIdentifier("readerMorePopover")`) and the
//     `TTSControlBar` (its root `HStack` carries
//     `accessibilityIdentifier("ttsControlBar")`) do exactly this, so
//     the per-row / per-button identifiers (`readerMoreReadAloud`,
//     `ttsPlayPauseButton`, `ttsStopButton`) do NOT resolve — confirmed
//     by an `app.debugDescription` dump of the live popover, where every
//     row surfaced as `identifier: 'readerMorePopover'`. This suite
//     therefore queries each control by its stable accessibility LABEL,
//     which the container identifier does NOT override:
//       - the "Read aloud" row → `label BEGINSWITH 'Read aloud'`
//       - the play/pause control → label `"Pause"` while speaking,
//         `"Resume"` while paused (set in `TTSControlBar`)
//       - the Stop control → label `"Stop reading"`.
