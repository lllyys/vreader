// Purpose: Feature #42 WI-11b/WI-12 — chapter-change dedup state + pure decision
// logic for the Readium bilingual enumerate/inject loop, split out of
// `ReadiumEPUBHost+Bilingual.swift` for the 300-line budget. A reference type so
// the host's `onLocationChange` closure mutates the live instance rather than a
// stale value snapshot; the static helpers are pure and unit-tested in
// `ReadiumBilingualChapterTrackerTests`.
//
// WI-12 behavior delta (Readium engine, `readiumEPUBEngine` flag ON): Readium
// scroll-mode bilingual enumerates PER-SPINE — one chapter at a time, on
// scroll-into-view (Readium emits `locationDidChange` at spine boundaries in
// scroll mode, which drives the same `handleBilingualLocationChange` enumerate
// the paged path uses). It does NOT reproduce legacy #71's stitched
// cross-chapter continuous bilingual: Readium has no multi-spine-stitch API, so
// off-screen spines enumerate only when scrolled into view, not eagerly across
// the whole book. Legacy #71 (EPUBWebViewBridge, `readiumEPUBEngine` flag OFF)
// is unaffected and keeps its full continuous-scroll bilingual. A paged↔scroll
// layout change re-renders the spine (stale `data-vreader-bid` stamps +
// decorations are discarded), so the layout-change handler RE-ENUMERATES the
// current spine in BOTH directions.
//
// @coordinates-with: ReadiumEPUBHost+Bilingual.swift,
//   ReadiumEPUBHost+BilingualDriver.swift, EPUBLayoutPreference.swift,
//   dev-docs/plans/20260519-feature-56-bilingual-reading.md (WI-11/WI-12)
