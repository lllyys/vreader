// Purpose: Feature #42 Phase 1 (WI-4) — DebugBridge probe support for the
// Readium EPUB reader engine. Adds a token-guarded registry slot for the
// active Readium navigator + a JS-eval seam so the Readium host (WI-5) can be
// verified CU-free (`eval?bridge=epub`-style probes) exactly like the legacy
// EPUBWebViewBridge / Foliate hosts.
//
// SPIKE RESULT (Risk 5 in the feature #42 plan): the Readium 3.9
// `EPUBNavigatorViewController` is NOT a single app-owned WKWebView — it owns
// its own (possibly multiple) internal spine webviews. But Readium 3.9 DOES
// expose a clean public JS-eval surface:
//
//   public func evaluateJavaScript(_ script: String) async -> Result<Any, Error>
//
// which runs JS on the currently-visible HTML resource (the active spine
// webview). So this probe does NOT need to reach Readium's internal webviews:
// it stores a `ReadiumNavigatorEvaluating` seam (which WI-5 conforms the real
// `EPUBNavigatorViewController` to via a thin adapter that JSON-serializes the
// `Result<Any, Error>` value), and exposes JS eval through that. The settle
// signal reuses the existing `markReaderSettled` / `awaitReaderSettled`
// machinery (DebugReaderRegistry+Settle.swift) — WI-5's host calls
// `markReaderSettled(for:token:)` from Readium's
// `navigator(_:locationDidChange:)` delegate (the relocate-equivalent that
// fires once a spine is rendered and the first location is reported).
//
// Wiring (WI-5): the Readium host registers its navigator on
// `navigator(_:locationDidChange:)` (or first render) via
// `setActiveReadiumNavigator(_:for:token:)`, and the eval-bridge handler reads
// the navigator back with `readiumNavigator(for:token:)`. Same keyed +
// per-reader-token stale-write guarding as the EPUB/Foliate slots
// (bug #126 / #142) so a late callback from an outgoing reader cannot clobber
// an incoming probe's binding.
//
// @coordinates-with DebugReaderRegistry.swift, DebugReaderRegistry+Settle.swift
// DEBUG-only.
