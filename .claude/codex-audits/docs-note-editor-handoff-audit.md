## Scope

Syncs the claude.ai/design "VReader Note Editor Canvas" handoff into
the `dev-docs/designs/vreader-fidelity-v1/` bundle. Touches the design
bundle, plus `project.yml` / `project.pbxproj` (version bump
3.34.10/497 → 3.34.11/498 (rebased onto main)).

**No Swift source files changed.** The audit-gate hook fires on
`project.pbxproj` — false positive of the Swift-file heuristic. Manual
mini-audit.

## Manual audit evidence

### What changed and why

Bundle sync (rsync, superset — nothing deleted): 4 new files —
`VReader Note Editor Canvas.html`, `note-editor-canvas-artboards.jsx`,
`vreader-note-editor.jsx`, `chats/chat4.md`; `README.md` +
`chats/chat2.md` updated.

The handoff delivers the committed design for `needs-design` issue
**#914** — the **highlight-note edit surface**. Per `vreader-note-editor.jsx`,
the design is a `HighlightNoteEditSheet`: a keyboard-anchored half-sheet
(sits above the iOS keyboard), `[Cancel] · "Note" · [Save]` header (Save
gated on a dirty draft; reads "Clear note" in destructive ink when the
draft empties a non-empty note), an italic excerpt strip with the
highlight swatch, a borderless Source-Serif textarea, and a footer with
char count + a delete-note destructive link. CJK is first-class (font
fallback, looser 1.85 line-height, `lang=` for IME); RTL via `dir="auto"`.
Save commits via the existing `HighlightPersisting.updateHighlightNote`.

### Correctness checks

1. **#914 is a real, open `needs-design` issue** — verified via
   `gh issue view 914`: OPEN, labels `enhancement` + `needs-design`,
   title "Design needed: highlight-note edit surface for feature #55".
2. **Issue → feature linkage** — #914's body names feature #55 and
   `Refs #619`. Feature #55's row (`docs/features.md`) is `PLANNED`,
   `GH: #619`. #914's body states explicitly: "The feature row itself
   is NOT blocked — only the Edit slice"; the Edit-slice block lives in
   `dev-docs/plans/20260519-feature-55-...md` §2.8/§8, not in the row.
   So no `docs/features.md` row carries a `#914` annotation and none is
   flipped here — committing the design simply unblocks the #55 Edit
   slice for whoever resumes that feature-workflow.
3. **Issue closure** — PR uses `Resolves #914` so the `needs-design`
   issue auto-closes on merge (same precedent as PR #869 for the
   issues-canvas / PR #848 for reader-navigation: a `needs-design`
   issue is resolved purely by the design being committed).
4. **No Swift implemented** — design-delivery only. Implementing the
   `HighlightNoteEditSheet` is gated feature-#55 feature-workflow work
   (Edit slice); deliberately not in this PR.
5. **Version bump** — 3.34.11 / build 498 (patch — docs / design-bundle
   sync). `xcodegen generate` confirmed.

## Verdict

ship-as-is — design-bundle sync + version bump. No Swift logic. Manual
fallback used because there is nothing to send to Codex.
